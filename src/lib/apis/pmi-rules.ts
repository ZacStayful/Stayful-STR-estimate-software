// ─── Compressed-premium postcodes ──────────────────────────────────
// Cities where the comp pool has a compressed high-end cluster and plain
// median materially under-predicts vs PMI. Confirmed from dataset:
//   EH1 Edinburgh Old Town: median −20% vs PMI; top-8 mean within 5%.
//   OX1 Oxford city centre: median −19% vs PMI; top-8 mean within 2%.
//   BA1 Bath Royal Crescent/centre: median −9% vs PMI; top-8 mean within 4%.
//   EH2 Edinburgh New Town: inferred as similar market to EH1 (same tourist
//       corridor); not directly tested — conservative addition.
//
// Tested and deliberately NOT included (plain median works within 10%):
//   YO1 York central (−4%), CB1/CB2 Cambridge central (−3%),
//   SW11 London Battersea (+8%), EC1R London Clerkenwell (+12% — median
//   overshoots if anything; adding to this list would worsen accuracy),
//   M1 Manchester Northern Quarter, E1 London Aldgate.

// (fires only when guests are at or above comp median guests; otherwise the
// under-spec rule below takes precedence).
//
// Derived from:
//   Nottingham NG1 4ET (bed_gap=+1, guest_gap=0): raw median undershoots by
//     −17%; boost of +15% closes to −5%.

//
// Derived from Glasgow G12 (subject guests=3, comp median guests=4; gap=−1):

// milder shrink may be appropriate. Only one confirmed sample — revisit when

// accidentally drop legitimate high-demand comps.
//
// Derived from:
//   Penrith 5-bed: comp #2 @ £884 ADR (vs pool median £289) inflated median
//     RevPAR by ~14%; dropping it brings prediction within 3%.
//   London EC1R: comp #1 @ £1215 ADR; dropping corrects similar inflation.
